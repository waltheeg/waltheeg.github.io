## Introduction

 Generally, describe μFluidic devices. 
• What is pinch flow fractionation? How does it work?  
• Provide at least one specific application that requires sorting of small particles. Include at least one citation from primary literature.  

## Design Instructions
**1. CAD Model**

## Discussion

* Why are resin-printed molds coated with parylene prior to casting the PDMS? What are 
hypothetical applications of your microfluidic mixer or sorter? 
• Why is your geometry conducive to sorting? Discuss specific dimensions (pinch width, 
outlet width, location of ports, etc.) 
• What steps or design features did you use to ensure that each outlet received the same 
flow rate, preventing disruptions to the streamlines and maintaining proper separation? 
• Based on the results of testing, could you implement any future changes to improve 
sorting?
